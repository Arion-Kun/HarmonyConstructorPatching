# Harmony Constructor Patching

__This is a C# preview of Constructor patching using the HarmonyLib Nuget Package instead of the In-Built MelonLoader.dll Harmony Package.__
__Packages differ slightly regarding HarmonyInstance.__

* The goal of the Repo is to demonstrate an example of how patching can be utilized to generate pre & postfix patches for constructors.
